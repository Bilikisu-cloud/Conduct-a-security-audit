# Conduct-a-security-audit
am currently pursuing a career in cybersecurity, driven by my passion for technology and my commitment to ensuring the safety and integrity of data. As a beginner in this field, I am developing a strong foundation in essential cybersecurity concepts, tools, and best practices. My learning journey is fueled by a combination of formal courses, self-study, and hands-on projects designed to deepen my understanding of how to protect information systems and prevent cyber threats.
I love food too.
